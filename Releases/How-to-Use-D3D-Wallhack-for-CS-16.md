D3D wallhack is a cheat that allows you to see through walls and other objects in Counter-Strike 1.6, a popular online first-person shooter game. It works by hooking into the DirectX 11 graphics engine and modifying the rendering of the game models. This gives you an unfair advantage over your opponents, as you can spot them before they see you.
